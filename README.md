# SuperHero App

“Not all heroes wear capes. Some write code.”

The SuperHero App is my very first project, created as part of the App Development course through FNB App Academy and IT Varsity.  
While simple in structure, this app reflects my effort to make something uniquely my own — a foundation for future growth in development and design.

## About the App

From layout to styling, every part of this project was crafted to reinforce the fundamentals of app creation while allowing space for creativity.
